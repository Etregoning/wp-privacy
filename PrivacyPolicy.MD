   to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please 
   read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect 
   or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our app.

  CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to 
   post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or 
   company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally 
   Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website 
   stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is 
   being shared.

   We are not a commercial service, but we are just trying to follow all best practices for privacy.   

  4.2: According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following: 
   Users can visit our site anonymously. 
   Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum,

   When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 
   years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. 
   The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA 
   Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect 
   children's privacy and safety online. 
   We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.   

  5.2: Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13? 
   This app is forbidden to be used by anyone under the age of 13. By agreeing to this privacy policy, 
   you are confirming that you are at least age 13 or older.   

  6.1: Fair Information Practices   

   The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States 
   and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection 
   laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should 
   be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information. 
   In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, 
   should a data breach occur we will notify you via email within 7 days.   


  6.2: We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to 
   legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. 
   This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that 
   individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance 
   by data processors.   

  7.1: CAN SPAM Act   

  The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for 
   commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, 
   and spells out tough penalties for violations.   

  7.2: We collect your email address in order to: 
   Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.

   Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.   


  7.4: Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly. 
   We do not send out any newsletters. Your email will only be used for the purpose of resetting 
   or changing your password. 
   This will never change, but we are agreeing to honor opt-out requests in the case that we decided 
   to send newsletters (We won't though) -- in order to be CANSPAM compliant.
